## Some basic information about me ℹ
### Work 💼
- 🤖 Currently I am a Research Scholar and Senior Teaching Fellow Coordinator at [__Stanford University__](https://profiles.stanford.edu/marek-miltner), where I focus on researching AI applications to decarbonize the Energy sector and teaching Computer Science to underprivileged high schoolers. 
- 💻 I also have 9+ years of work experience both in deep tech, strategy consulting, and tech leadership. I am ***not*** currently considering new work offers<!--, [let me know your proposals 💌](mailto:marek.szeles@eforce.cvut.cz)-->. Here is a short summary of my experience, or see [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marek-szeles/) for details:
   - Over 5 years in consulting mostly at the Boston Consulting Group finishing as a client-facing technical consultant, most notably overseeing the tech aspects of an acquisition of a global pharma company, and leading a successful multi-billion EUR IT transformation there.
   - Following that, I co-founded and led a disruptive research team developing autonomous racing vehicles at Czech Technical University. The team later won races and beat prestigious teams from universities including MIT (🇺🇸), ETH Zurich (🇨🇭) or KIT (🇩🇪). Based on this I was invited to study and continue my research at the University of Cambridge in the UK 🇬🇧.
   - Afterwards, I turned to startups serving in senior Tech Leadership roles, having been awarded AI Development CTO of the Year in 2022 for my role of CTO at [__Vizgard (🇬🇧)__](https://www.vizgard.com), followed by being Head of Engineering at [__Uizard (🇩🇰)__](https://www.uizard.io), a similar-sounding but very different AI startup I helped scale and get acquired.
   - After my startup years, I decided I wanted to be motivated more by impact and less by profit for a few more years of my peak productive years and I did an unusual U-turn to return to academia to pursue a PhD applying AI to help sustainably decarbonize power systems. I also did the unthinkable by not taking up offers at Cambridge or Stanford and instead went back to Prague to prioritize family. Stanford was very nice and keen to have me however and so I ended up with dual affiliations and supervisors with both CTU in Prague and Stanford, commuting between continents, which is a dream scenario, really! 🙌
- Experience with onsite work in 🇺🇸, 🇬🇧, 🇨🇿, 🇩🇪, 🇦🇹, 🇩🇰, 🇳🇴, 🇫🇮, 🇪🇪, 🇧🇪, 🇳🇱, 🇵🇹, 🇨🇭, 🇷🇺, 🇰🇿, 🇮🇳, 🇲🇾, 🇸🇬, 🇯🇵 and remote work as well; currently I am based in: Stanford / SF, 🇺🇸 with regular business travel to Prague, 🇨🇿  <!---->. <!-- TODO add CV sometime -->
- 👨‍💻 Tech stack: Python, JuPyteR Notebooks, Java, Kotlin, C++, Embedded-C, JavaScript(React, NodeJS), SQL, PHP, VBA
